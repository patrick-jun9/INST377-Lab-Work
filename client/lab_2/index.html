Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
If you build this page right, your images will form a small "carousel"
